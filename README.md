# It Was Never There (Add-On)

### Narrative

The player wokes up in a normal world, everything seems right. Gathering wood, mining stone, exploring caves for iron, everything seems normal.

You gather torches and build a house before the night comes but... you aren't sure
why everything is too normal.

> "What is this add-on for?" you tell to yourself. 

You place down the bed and sleeps through the night.

While sleeping you are awaken by some unexplainable noise, you can't sleep, it throws you off so you decided to go outside. 

> "Nothing is here..." you whisper to yourself.

But your bed is gone.

Just... gone.
No explosion. No endermen. No sign of disturbance.

A cold chill creeps up your spine. You open your inventory to make a new bed but the wool and wood are missing. Completely.

You know you had them. You remember crafting extra planks.
You even remember the sheep. The sound they made.

But your memory doesn't match your reality.
Thereâ€™s nothing in your inventory. No logs. No planks. No wool.

It was like...<br>
It was never there.

### Mechanics

- The player speaks/chats to himself following the narrative, mimicking that the player has become mentally disturbed.
- The surroundings changes when the player isn't looking, there is always a feeling of being watched.
- There are notebooks or signs that convinces the player that it was never there.
- Spooky sounds when the player is in a enclosed space or not.
- Player must blink every 2-4 seconds or the situation keeps getting worse as the screen becomes blurry.
- Items in the player inventory randomly disappearing.
- Item name on the items inside the player inventory distorts to something unmeaningful.
